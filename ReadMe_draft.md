Bee Colonies Survival Prediction

Overview
This repository contains code for predicting the survival of bee colonies based on various factors related to beekeeping practices and environmental conditions. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to make predictions. The models include logistic regression and a random forest classifier.

Files
save_the_bees.db: SQLite database containing bee colonies data.

Results
The analysis provides insights into predicting bee colony survival, highlighting key features such as varroa mites, pesticides, and diseases. The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated improved performance over Logistic Regression.

Recommendations
 *Monitor and manage varroa mites and pesticide usage.
 *Conduct periodic disease surveillance for proactive control.
 *Utilize predictive models for anticipating colony survival rates.
 *Consider further research for enhancing predictive accuracy.
