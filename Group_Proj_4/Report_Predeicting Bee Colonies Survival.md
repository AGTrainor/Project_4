Report: Predicting Bee Colonies Survival
Executive Summary:
The objective of this analysis is to predict the survival of bee colonies using various features related to beekeeping practices and environmental factors. The dataset was obtained from the "save_the_bees" database and contains information on bee colonies across different states, including the number of colonies, factors contributing to colony losses, and the presence of various pests and diseases.

The analysis is structured into several key steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning:

The data was loaded from the SQLite database into a Pandas DataFrame.
Unnecessary columns were removed, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
Descriptive statistics of the dataset were examined for insights into the distribution of key variables.
Feature Engineering:

Categorical variables were one-hot encoded to create binary columns representing different states.
The dataset was further refined to include relevant features for modeling.
Model Iteration 1 (Regression - Predicting Percent Lost):

The initial model aimed to predict the percentage of bee colonies lost.
Features included varroa mites, pesticides, diseases, unknown factors, quarter, other pests, and the year.
Logistic Regression was employed, achieving a certain level of accuracy on training and testing datasets.
Binning Percent Lost:

The "percent_lost" variable was binned into two categories (0 and 1) to facilitate classification.
Outliers were removed, and the dataset was re-indexed.
Model Iteration 2 (Classification - Predicting Binary Target):

A logistic regression model was applied to predict the binary target variable (0 or 1) based on the binned percent lost.
Features remained consistent with Model Iteration 1.
Model Iteration 3 (Outlier Removal):

Outliers were identified and removed from the "other_pests_and_parasites" and "diseases" columns.
The logistic regression model was reapplied after outlier removal.
Model Iteration 4 (Random Forest Classifier):

A Random Forest Classifier was introduced as a more complex model to improve predictive performance.
Feature importance was visualized to understand the contribution of each feature to the model.
Conclusion and Recommendations:

The analysis provides valuable insights into predicting bee colony survival.
Random Forest Classifier demonstrated improved performance over Logistic Regression.
Key features contributing to the prediction include varroa mites, pesticides, diseases, and other pests.
Recommendations:
Monitoring Varroa Mites and Pesticide Usage:

Given their significant contribution to the predictive models, beekeepers should focus on monitoring and managing varroa mites and pesticides to mitigate colony losses.
Periodic Disease Surveillance:

Regular surveillance and control measures against diseases impacting bee colonies are crucial for sustaining their health and survival.
Utilizing Predictive Models:

Beekeepers can leverage the developed models to anticipate colony survival rates based on various factors, allowing for proactive management strategies.
Further Research:

Continuous research into additional factors affecting bee colonies and the development of more sophisticated models can enhance predictive accuracy.
This analysis contributes to the ongoing efforts to address the decline in bee populations and emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in beekeeping practices.
