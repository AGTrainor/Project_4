Bee Colonies Survival Prediction Overview


This repository contains code for predicting the survival of bee colonies based on various factors related to beekeeping practices and environmental conditions. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to make predictions. The models include logistic regression and a random forest classifier.

Files
save_the_bees.db: SQLite database containing bee colonies data.
Save_The_Bees Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for data analysis and model development.
save_the_bees_graphs.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to export database for Tableau graphing.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, sqlalchemy, matplotlib, seaborn

Install the required libraries using:
pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn sqlalchemy matplotlib seaborn

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/"/AGTrainor/Project_4".git
cd AGTrainor/Project_4

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter Save_The_Bees Model.ipynb
Follow the notebook to execute code cells and explore the analysis.

Results
The analysis provides insights into predicting bee colony survival, highlighting key features such as varroa mites, pesticides, and diseases. The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated improved performance over Logistic Regression.
